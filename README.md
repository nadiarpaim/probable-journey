# Challenge!

## Scenario

You are a book publisher, and all of your authors are
lazy and send their book titles in lower case.

## Challenge

Create a function that when passed a string as a parameter,
returns the same string in `Title Case`


### Help on title case

Title Case is when all words begin with a capital letter.

- lower case
- UPPER CASE
- Title Case

You are gonna have to use split and loops.
